# Splunkbase Download Utility

This utility provides a convenient method for Splunk administrators to download Splunkbase apps via the command line using a Python3 script. 

## Installation

Simply download the script and make it executable:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcusschiesser/splunkbase-download/main/download-splunkbase.py
chmod +x ./download-splunkbase.py
```

Call then `./download-splunkbase.py` to get help how to use the script.

If needed, install the requirements:
```
pip install $(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcusschiesser/splunkbase-download/main/requirements.txt)
```

## History 

It's inspired by [https://github.com/tfrederick74656/splunkbase-download](https://github.com/tfrederick74656/splunkbase-download)
which unfortunately wasn't working anymore with `sid` and `SSOID` authentication as [Splunk changed the authentication method](https://github.com/tfrederick74656/splunkbase-download/issues/1). 
I initially fixed that, but then Splunk again changed the authentication (Please stop doing that!).
Kudos to [torhment](https://github.com/Tohrment) - he helped out and fixed it again in his [download_splunkbase_app](https://github.com/Tohrment/download_splunkbase_app). I merged his approach to my app too as our both apps have a slightly different usage interface. Mine is used by the [splunk-gitops](https://github.com/marcusschiesser/splunk-gitops) project.
